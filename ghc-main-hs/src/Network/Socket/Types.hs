-- Socket types

-- There are a few possible ways to do this.  The first is convert the
-- structs used in the C library into an equivalent Haskell type. An
-- other possible implementation is to keep all the internals in the C
-- code and use an Int## and a status flag. The second method is used
-- here since a lot of the C structures are not required to be
-- manipulated.

-- Originally the status was non-mutable so we had to return a new
-- socket each time we changed the status.  This version now uses
-- mutable variables to avoid the need to do this.  The result is a
-- cleaner interface and better security since the application
-- programmer now can't circumvent the status information to perform
-- invalid operations on sockets.

-- socket type is supported on your system: see 'isSupportedSocketType'.

-- Socket addresses

-- The scheme used for addressing sockets is somewhat quirky. The
-- calls in the BSD socket API that need to know the socket address
-- all operate in terms of struct sockaddr, a `virtual' type of
-- socket address.

-- The Internet family of sockets are addressed as struct sockaddr_in,
-- so when calling functions that operate on struct sockaddr, we have
-- to type cast the Internet socket address into a struct sockaddr.
-- Instances of the structure for different families might *not* be
-- the same size. Same casting is required of other families of
-- sockets such as Xerox NS. Similarly for Unix domain sockets.

-- To represent these socket addresses in Haskell-land, we do what BSD
-- didn't do, and use a union/algebraic type for the different
-- families. Currently only Unix domain sockets and the Internet
-- families are supported.
