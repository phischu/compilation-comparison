-- | A common problem is the desire to have an action run at a scheduled
-- interval, but only if it is needed. For example, instead of having
-- every web request result in a new @getCurrentTime@ call, we'd like to
-- have a single worker thread run every second, updating an @IORef@.
-- However, if the request frequency is less than once per second, this is
-- a pessimization, and worse, kills idle GC.
--
-- This library allows you to define actions which will either be
-- performed by a dedicated thread or, in times of low volume, will be
-- executed by the calling thread.
