-- GHC ≤ 7.10 does not export Applicative functions from the prelude.

-- $howto
-- This module provides 'Middleware' to rewrite URL paths. It also provides
-- functions that will convert a 'Request' to a modified 'Request'.
-- Both operations require a function that takes URL parameters and
-- headers, and returns new URL parameters. Parameters are pieces of URL
-- paths and query parameters.
--
-- If you are a new user of the library, use 'rewriteWithQueries' or
-- 'rewritePureWithQueries' for middleware. For modifying 'Request's
-- directly, use 'rewriteRequest' or 'rewriteRequestPure'.

-- $semantics
--
-- Versions of this library in wai-extra ≤ 3.0.16.1 exported only
-- 'rewrite' and 'rewritePure' and both modified 'rawPathInfo' of the
-- underlying requests. Such modification has been proscribed. The
-- semantics of these functions have not changed; instead the recommended
-- approach is to use 'rewriteWithQueries' and 'rewritePureWithQueries'.
-- The new functions are slightly different, as described in the section
-- on upgrading; code for previous library versions can be upgraded with
-- a single change, and as the type of the new function is different the
-- compiler will indicate where this change must be made.
--
-- The 'rewriteRequest' and 'rewriteRequestPure' functions use the new
-- semantics, too.

-- $pathsandqueries
--
-- This library defines the type synonym `PathsAndQueries` to make code
-- handling paths and queries easier to read.
--
-- /e.g./ /\/foo\/bar/ would look like
--
-- > ["foo", "bar"] :: Text
--
-- /?bar=baz/ would look like
--
-- > [("bar", Just "baz")] :: QueryText
--
-- Together,
--
-- /\/foo?bar=baz/ would look like
--
-- > (["foo"],[("bar", Just "baz")]) :: PathsAndQueries

-- $takeover
-- Let’s say we want to replace a website written in PHP with one written
-- using WAI. We’ll use the
-- <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/http-reverse-proxy http-reverse-proxy>
-- package to serve the old
-- site from the new site, but there’s a problem. The old site uses pages like
--
-- @
-- index.php?page=/page/
-- @
--
-- whereas the new site would look like
--
-- @
-- index\//page/
-- @
--
-- In doing this, we want to separate the migration code from our new
-- website. So we’d like to handle links internally using the path
-- formulation, but externally have the old links still work.
--
-- Therefore, we will use middleware ('rewritePureWithQueries') from this
-- module to rewrite incoming requests from the query formulation to the
-- paths formulation.
--
-- > {-# LANGUAGE ViewPatterns #-}
-- >
-- > rewritePathFromPhp :: Middleware
-- > rewritePathFromPhp = rewritePureWithQueries pathFromPhp
-- >
-- > pathFromPhp :: PathsAndQueries -> H.RequestHeaders -> PathsAndQueries
-- > pathFromPhp (pieces, queries) _ = piecesConvert pieces queries
-- >     where
-- >         piecesConvert :: [Text] -> H.Query -> PathsAndQueries
-- >         piecesConvert ["index.php"] qs@(join . lookup "page" -> Just page) =
-- >             ( ["index", TE.decodeUtf8With TE.lenientDecode page]
-- >             , delete ("page", pure page) qs
-- >             )
-- >         piecesConvert ps qs = (ps, qs)
--
-- On the other side, we will use 'rewriteRequestPure' to rewrite outgoing
-- requests to the original website from the reverse proxy code (using the
-- 'Network.HTTP.ReverseProxy.WPRModifiedRequest' or
-- 'Network.HTTP.ReverseProxy.WPRModifiedRequestSecure' constructors. Note,
-- these links will only work if the haddock documentation for
-- <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/http-reverse-proxy http-reverse-proxy>
-- is installed).

-- >         piecesConvert :: [Text] -> H.Query -> PathsAndQueries
-- >         piecesConvert ["index", page] qs = ( ["index.php"], ("page", pure . TE.encodeUtf8 $ page) : qs )

-- $upgrading
-- It is quite simple to upgrade from 'rewrite' and 'rewritePure', to
-- 'rewriteWithQueries' and 'rewritePureWithQueries'.
-- Insert 'Data.Bifunctor.first', which specialises to
--
-- @
-- 'Data.Bifunctor.first' :: (['Text'] -> ['Text']) -> 'PathsAndQueries' -> 'PathsAndQueries'
-- @
--
-- as the following example demonstrates.
--
-- Old versions of the libary could only handle path pieces, not queries.
-- This could have been supplied to 'rewritePure'.
--
-- @
-- staticConvert' :: [Text] -> H.RequestHeaders -> [Text]
-- staticConvert' pieces _ = piecesConvert pieces
--   where
--    piecesConvert [] = ["static", "html", "pages.html"]
--    piecesConvert route@("pages":_) = "static":"html":route
-- @
--
-- Instead, use this function, supplied to 'rewritePureWithQueries'.
--
-- @
-- staticConvert :: 'PathsAndQueries' -> H.RequestHeaders -> 'PathsAndQueries'
-- staticConvert pathsAndQueries _ = 'Data.Bifunctor.first' piecesConvert pathsAndQueries
--   where
--    piecesConvert [] = ["static", "html", "pages.html"]
--    piecesConvert route@("pages":_) = "static":"html":route
-- @
--
-- The former formulation is deprecated for two reasons:
--
--   1. The original formulation of 'rewrite' modified 'rawPathInfo', which
--   is deprecated behaviour.
--
--   2. The original formulation did not allow query parameters to
--   influence the path.
--
-- Concerning the first point, take care with semantics of your program when
-- upgrading as the upgraded functions no longer modify 'rawPathInfo'.

--------------------------------------------------
-- * Types
--------------------------------------------------

-- | A tuple of the path sections as ['Text'] and query parameters as
-- 'H.Query'. This makes writing type signatures for the conversion
-- function far more pleasant.
--
-- Note that this uses 'H.Query' not 'H.QueryText' to more accurately
-- reflect the paramaters that can be supplied in URLs. It may be safe to
-- treat parameters as text; use the 'H.queryToQueryText' and
-- 'H.queryTextToQuery' functions to interconvert.
type PathsAndQueries = ([Text], H.Query)

-- * Rewriting 'Middleware'
