-- | Middleware for establishing the root of the application.
--
-- Many application need the ability to create URLs referring back to the
-- application itself. For example: generate RSS feeds or sitemaps, giving
-- users copy-paste links, or sending emails. In many cases, the approot can be
-- determined correctly from the request headers. However, some things can
-- prevent this, especially reverse proxies. This module provides multiple ways
-- of configuring approot discovery, and functions for applications to get that
-- approot.
--
-- Approots are structured such that they can be prepended to a string such as
-- @/foo/bar?baz=bin@. For example, if your application is hosted on
-- example.com using HTTPS, the approot would be @https://example.com@. Note
-- the lack of a trailing slash.

--
-- * Requests which spoof headers and imply the connection is over HTTPS
--
-- * Reverse proxies that change ports in surprising ways
--
-- * Invalid Host headers
--
-- * Reverse proxies which modify the path info
--
-- Normally trusting headers in this way is insecure, however in the case of
-- approot, the worst that can happen is that the client will get an incorrect
-- URL. If you are relying on the approot for some security-sensitive purpose,
-- it is highly recommended to use @hardcoded@, which cannot be spoofed.
