--
-- A @ResourceT@ has some restrictions on its base monad:

-- * @MonadResource@ requires an instance of @MonadThrow@, @MonadIO@, and @Applicative@.
--
-- While any instance of @MonadBaseControl IO@ should be an instance of the
-- other classes, this is not guaranteed by the type system (e.g., you may have

-- we would like to simply create an alias for the five type classes listed,
-- but this is not possible with GHC currently.
--
-- Instead, this typeclass acts as a proxy for the other five. Its only purpose
-- is to make your type signatures shorter.

-- Note that earlier versions of @conduit@ had a typeclass @ResourceIO@. This
-- fulfills much the same role.

-- instead of wrapping around @ResourceT@ itself. This section provides you the
